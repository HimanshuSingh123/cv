  <h1> All About Me!</h1>

  <p>My name is Himanshu Singh and I am third year software engineering student at Carleton University with one coop term of related experience as a Software Tester. I grew up in Mississauga and gained an interest in programming, game development and
    robotics throughout my time in middle school. In high school is where I joined a science and technology related program where technology related projects were a lot more difficult than they regularly would be. Just to put it into perspective, in
    Grade 9 I had to design a robot that would follow a black line and I got graded for how far it went in a time limit. Because of the work I did in the following grades I decided to apply to Carleton’s Software Engineering program. At my time at
    Carleton I’ve learned many different principles and methodologies to apply to code and have done well so far while doing related extracurriculars and personal projects.


    I’ve also worked as an area manager at a night-shift job where I significantly improved upon my teamwork, collaboration, and management skills. I was also working a job while in school last semester and that also improved my time management
    skills significantly. In my short time as a software tester, I’ve managed to find multiple bugs working on two projects with two different teams simultaneously while performing decent. Working as a software tester has helped me hone my version
    control and project management skills, AGILE to be specific. Ideally, I would like to continue to work on my software engineering experience while learning about/creating brand technology, </p>
